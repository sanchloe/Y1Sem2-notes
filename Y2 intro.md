# Year 2 

1. Operating Systems and Concurrency

    This course covers the fundamental principles that underpin operating systems and concurrency. Topics covered include the **architecture of operating systems, process and memory management, storage, I/O, and virtualisation**.

    The principles of concurrency will be introduced from both the perspective of an operating system and user applications. Specific topics on concurrency include: **hardware support for concurrency; mutual exclusion and condition synchronisation; monitors; safety and liveness properties of concurrent algorithms, and the use of threads and synchronisation**.

1. Algorithms, Correctness and Efficiency
    This module covers important aspects of algorithms, namely their correctness and efficiency.

    Youâ€™ll study topics such as:

   - proofs in propositional logic and predicate logic
   - classical vs. intuitionistic reasoning
   - basic operations on types
   - verification of list based programs
   - introduction to program specification and program correctness
  
    To address the issue of efficiency we cover the **use of mathematical descriptions of the computational resources** needed to support algorithm design decisions.
    The emphasis is upon understanding **data structures** and algorithms so as to be able to design and select them appropriately for solving a given problem.

3. Languages and Computation

    You'll investigate classes of formal language and the practical uses of this theory, applying this to a series of abstract machines ultimately leading to a discussion on **what computation is and what can and cannot be computed**.

    You'll focus in particular on language recognition, but will study a range of topics including:

   - finite state machines
   - regular expressions
   - context-free grammars
   - Turing machines
   - Lambda calculus
    This module builds on parts of the ACE module **addressing data structures and formal reasoning** and introduces concepts which are important to understand **the analysis of algorithms in terms of their complexity**.

4. Software Maintenance
    
    This module builds on your basic Java programming and software engineering skills developed in year one, extending it to working with larger third-party software systems and the challenges associated with this.

    Topic examples include:

    - design diagrams and modelling
    - GUI programming
    - testing software engineering methodologies (including agile development)
    - All in the context of understanding and refactoring third-party code.

    You will spend around two hours per week in lectures, two hours per week in computer classes, and one hour per week in workshops studying for this module.

5. Artificial Intelligence Methods
    This module builds on the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence module. The emphasis is on building on the AI research strengths in the School.

    You will be introduced to key topics such as **AI techniques, fuzzy logic and planning, and modern search techniques such as Iterated Local Search, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and Hyper-heuristics**, etc.

    You will also explore the **implementation of some AI techniques**.
